        <p>Hi! I'm Anandh Raj R., a passionate and aspiring software developer currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA). With a strong foundation in Full Stack Java, MERN stack, and Spring Boot, I'm always eager to apply my knowledge to real-world projects and solve meaningful problems.</p>
        <p>My areas of expertise include Java, Spring Boot, MERN Stack, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and MySQL.</p>
        <p>I have a growing interest in system design and backend development, and I’m currently working on BringMyCart, a shopping assistant that integrates browser extension technology with a responsive web platform.</p>
        <p>I thrive in challenging environments and am always eager to learn, adapt, and push the boundaries of what’s possible in software development. I'm actively sharpening my problem-solving skills through platforms like HackerRank, where I regularly take on coding challenges to stay sharp and competitive. Currently, I’m seeking a Software Engineering internship where I can contribute, grow, and gain hands-on experience in a dynamic team setting.</p>
